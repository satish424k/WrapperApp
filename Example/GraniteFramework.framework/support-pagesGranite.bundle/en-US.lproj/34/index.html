			<article>
				<h1 class="question"><span>Lyric is not finding my in home Wi-Fi network</span></h1>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Lyric only operates in the 2.4GHz range.  That is why the thermostat does not see the network but the smart phone (which operates in both the 2.4 and 5.0 GHz range) sees the network just fine.  Most routers will broadcast two networks, one SSID on the 5GHz radio and one SSID on the 2.4GHz radio.</p>
